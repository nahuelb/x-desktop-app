# Writing Style

Customize this file to match your voice. Copy it to `WRITING_STYLE.md` (gitignored) and fill in your details.

The AI agent uses this as context alongside the system prompt in `src/main/constants.ts`.

## About the user

- Who you are and what you do
- What topics you post about
- Your audience

## Writing style

- all lowercase always, never capitalize anything
- no emojis
- informal and conversational
- under 280 chars for tweets

## Reference posts

Paste 3-5 of your own tweets so the agent can match your tone:

- "example tweet one"
- "example tweet two"
